They could be asked to create a production plant for any type of product ranging from a simple packaging
system to a variety of electronic devices.
Recently they have been asked to create a production line for multimedia devices which include music
and movie players. They wish to employee you to design a template in Java for creating and recording all
future production line items. For this particular production facility you will only implement a concrete
class for music and movie players.
Your task is to create a flexible structure that could be used in any production line. This structure would
then allow easy modification to handle different products.

For our project, we have performed interfaces, hierarchy, polymorphism, and enumerators exercises. These type of exercises helped 
us complete our steps with different types of classes, but some could interact with each other.
